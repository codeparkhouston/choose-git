# Choose your own adventure!

This is a repo for a workshop where we practice collaborating on a repo together!

The theme of this practice repo is in the style of a "Choose your own adventure" story.

## Getting started

1. Clone this `repo`
1. Create a file with a story about your character in the `characters` folder.
1. `git add`, `git commit -m`
1. `git push origin master`!

We've all now collaborated on the same repo!
